## Objectives:

To provide an interactive dashboard allows user select and explore various conditions and sample data that exist in tester's belly button.

## Delivery:

Upon selecting a tester (participant) from the dropdown box, its corresponding details will be displayed, a bar chart shows top 10 samples, a gauge chart shows wash frequence of the tester, a bubble chart shows sample sizes (bubble size) and types exist in the belly button.

### Tools:

- Plotly, HTML, CSS, Javascript.

### About the Data

[Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
